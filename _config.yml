  I am an third-year undergraduate statistics student who utilizes Python, R, and C++ to solve relevant, real-world problems.
  <br><br>
  Some of my interests include: machine learning, classification algorithms, high-dimensional data analysis, and bayesian classification. 
  <br><br>
  In my free time, I enjoy taking digital and film  <u><a href="https://dylanrollinss.github.io/photography">photos</a></u>. My work has been featured by the City of Chicago.
